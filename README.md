# üéÆ **Game Title** 

> **Short Pitch**: My game is a 2D jump-and-run platformer where the player has to defeat enemies, collect items, and reach a portal in order to progress to the next level. The player assumes the role of a former fashion designer who now seeks to bring balance back to a fractured multiverse after the Magical String of Love was shattered.

Armed with the Magical String, players will be enabled to take part in fast-paced combat, collecting items and defeating enemies deftly to unlock the portal at the end of each level. Every stage brings new challenges, enemies, and environments that demand skillful movement and precise attacks. The game is all about fluid platforming, engaging enemy encounters, and rewarding progression, making each level a test of agility and combat strategy.

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The theme and style came together seamlessly, and the sprites were fun to design.
- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity-based gameplay worked better than expected and provided a unique challenge.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Implementing all the features we envisioned wasn‚Äôt possible due to the limited timeframe.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped refine the core mechanics quickly.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.
